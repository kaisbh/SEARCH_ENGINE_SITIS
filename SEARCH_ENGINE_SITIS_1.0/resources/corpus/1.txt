BACKGROUND: In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial, consolidation
treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) decreased the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) progression after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, the 
impact of BV consolidation on overall survival, quality of life, and health care 
costs remain unclear.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to measure the costs
and clinical outcomes for BV consolidation therapy compared with active
surveillance in a cohort of patients aged 33 years who were at risk for HL
relapse after ASCT. Life-time costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each post-ASCT 
strategy.
RESULTS: After quality-of-life adjustments and standard discounting, upfront BV
consolidation was associated with an improvement of 1.07 QALYs compared with
active surveillance plus BV as salvage. However, the strategy of BV consolidation
led to significantly higher health care costs ($378,832 vs $219,761), resulting
in an ICER for BV consolidation compared with active surveillance of
$148,664/QALY. If indication-specific pricing was implemented, then the
model-estimated BV price reductions of 18% to 38% for the consolidative setting
would translate into ICERs of $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY, respectively. These 
findings were consistent on 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: BV as consolidation therapy under current US pricing is unlikely to 
be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY.
However, indication-specific price reductions for the consolidative setting could
reduce ICERs to widely acceptable values. Cancer 2017. © 2017 American Cancer
