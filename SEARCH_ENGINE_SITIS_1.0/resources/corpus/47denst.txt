Abstract
Ferric sulfate (FS) has been commonly used as a local hemostatic agent for more than three decades in dentistry. Even though
the hemostatic mechanism of FS is questioned, it seems that agglutination of blood proteins occurs due to the reaction of blood
with ferric and sulfate ions in acidic pH. FS has gained widespread importance as a pulpotomy medicament in contemporary
dentistry; nevertheless, it has several applications in different fields of dentistry which was paid little attention. Hence, the
purpose of this paper is to review the various applications of FS in dentistry, along with restorative dentistry and endodontics.
Keywords: Applications; dentistry; ferric sulfate; hemostasis
INTRODUCTION
Ferric sulfate or FS [Fe2
(SO4
)
3
] is a sulfate of trivalent iron.
It is yellow in color with a rhombic crystalline salt and is
soluble in water at room temperature. It is produced on a
large scale by the reaction of sulfuric acid, a hot solution
of ferrous sulfate, with an oxidizing agent. It was first
introduced in the field of dermatology as Monsel’s solution
in 1856.[1] In dentistry, 15%–20% FS is used as an astringent
and styptic.[2,3] Hemostatic action of FS is due to the
agglutination of blood proteins resulting from the reaction
of blood with ferric and sulfate ions in acidic pH.[4] The
agglutinated proteins form plugs that occlude the capillary
orifices.[5]
FS is available in two chemical forms.
Ferric subsulfate [Fe4
(OH)2
(SO4
)5
] (Monsel’s
solution)
Monsel’s solution, 20% FS, is used as an effective
styptic agent in skin and mucosal biopsies.[1,4,6]
However, the ferric and ferrous salts are corrosive and
injurious to the soft, as well as hard tissues, causing
subsequent staining of the teeth due to its high
acidity (pH <1).[4,7] The postoperative complications
associated with the soft tissues are delayed
reepithelialization and dyspigmentation.[8,9] It also
causes reactive and degenerative changes.[1,10] Armstrong
et al.
[9] observed inflammation, higher incidence of
wound infection, and delayed reepithelialization rate in
the punch biopsy wounds treated by Monsel’s solution
compared to collagen matrix at 4 weeks.
Ferric sulfate [Fe2
(SO4
)3
]
As a 15.5% solution, FS is a coagulative and hemostatic
agent which forms ferric ion-protein complex on contact
with blood. It seals the damaged vessels mechanically,
thus producing hemostasis, and the capillary orifices are
occluded by the agglutinated protein complex, which
prevents blood clot formation.[1] It causes a local and
reversible inflammatory response to the oral soft tissues.[11]
The recommended application time is 1–3 min and should
be placed directly against the damaged tissue due to its
quick action. Solutions of FS above 15% are highly acidic and
may cause considerable tissue irritation and postoperative
root sensitivity.
FS is available commercially with different
names [Table 1].[2,12-15]

APPLICATIONS OF FERRIC SULFATE IN
DENTISTRY
Pulpotomy medicament
FS has been commonly used as a pulpotomy medicament
to control pulpal bleeding in vital pulp therapy since
three decades. It induces hemostasis by forming a sealing
membrane at the damaged vessels of pulpal tissue by
agglutinating the blood proteins with ferric and sulfate
ions.[12]
The nonaldehyde form of FS is most preferred as a
pulpotomy agent due to its mechanism of controlling
hemorrhage, believed to be associated with physiological
clot formation. This might minimize the chances of
inflammation and internal resorption when placed on the
amputated pulp tissue for 5 min.[16,17]
The most important form of FS is minimal devitalization
and preservation of the pulp tissue.[13] The metal-protein
clot at the surface of the amputated pulp stumps may
probably act as a barrier to the irritative components of the
sub-base and functions exclusively in a passive manner.[18]
FS showed superior quality of minimizing inflammation
and internal resorption compared to calcium hydroxide
because of physiological clot formation by the agglutinated
proteins.[5,16]
Landau and Johnsen[19] reported the application of FS as
a pulpotomy medicament in monkey teeth. Fei et al.
[12]
published the first human clinical trial using FS with 100%
clinical success, compared to formocresol (77%) with
1-year follow-up. Similarly, Fuks et al.
[13] reported a study
employing FS showing high radiographic success rate of
74.5%.
Antibacterial agent
FS not only exhibited hemostatic action but also has
antimicrobial activity. Antibacterial efficacy of FS is
similar to 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate but better than
Ankaferd blood stopper® on oral microorganisms such
as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida
albicans, Candida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus
mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans under in vitro condition.[20] This
might be due to its acidic pH[4] and cytotoxicity.[5] In
addition, the occlusion of capillary orifices by agglutinated
proteins prevents the ingress of bacteria.[20]
During restorative procedures
FS in a concentration of 15.5%–20%[21] is one of the most
common chemical hemostatic reagents used in the
restorative dentistry.[22-24] It is chemically impregnated into
retraction cords in chemomechanical gingival retraction
technique in which FS is used in 15%–25% concentration
for 3–10 min[24] and offers greater sulcus displacement due
to combined physical and chemical effect.[21] Nevertheless,
high acidity of gingival retraction fluids and the high
affinity of ferric ions for hard tooth structures results in the
interaction with bacterial byproducts and precipitation of
insoluble ferric sulfide in the porous demineralized dentin.
This is the reason for internal discoloration of the dentin.
Conrad and Holtan[25] observed that use of FS gingival
retraction fluid in combination with translucent porcelain
restorations resulted in black internal discoloration of the
dentin under porcelain crowns.
Dentinal exposure to such highly acidic solutions of
FS (pH range of 0.7–2.0), for 30 s, results in rapid removal
of superficial smear layer and peritubular dentin was
also lost after prolonged exposure.[26] Furthermore,
removal of smear layer by hemostatic agents has been
suggested to negatively affect the bonding mechanism
of self-etching adhesive,[25,27] which may further promote
marginal microleakage and discoloration.[28] Hence, cavity
disinfection-associated resin composite restorations is
material specific.[29] Cohesive failures were observed in
primary dentin bonded with self-etch adhesive systems
after application of FS.[30] Ebrahimi et al.
[31] observed
that dentin surfaces contaminated with ViscoStat® for
60 s before applying adhesives showed reduced shear
bond strength of adhesive to dentin. Most of the failures
observed were adhesive.
To achieve better outcomes during impression making
or application of bonding agents, the hemostatic agents
applied before or during etching should be rinsed off
properly to create a dentin smear layer. However, rinsing
alone cannot eliminate surfaces contamination and thus
the remnant FS interfered with diffusion of adhesive in
dentinal tubules.[31,32] Because of the weak acidity of the
primer in self-etch adhesives, they could not dissolve the
contamination by ViscoStat®;
[33] hence, it is impossible to
penetrate deeper into dentin.[32] The suggested mechanism
was that hemostatic agent causes derangement in bonding
procedure because of dentinal tubules obturation and
dentinal surface was demineralized in different values.[28]
It is preferably recommended that FS should be used with
etch-and-rinse adhesive systems only.[24] Use of self-etching

adhesive significantly lowered the bond strength of dentin
contaminated with the hemostatic agent compared to
normal dentin. Kuphasuck et al.
[28] found that the hemostatic
agent does not have any effect on dentin bond strength of
the total-etching adhesive.
For gingival displacement in prosthodontics
Fischer (1987) first used FS as a coagulative and hemostatic
agent during crown and bridge impressions.[4] It is used for
tissue displacement and it would be maintained for at least
30 min.[4,14] Nonetheless, its use for gingival displacement
in implantology is not clearly understood as a result of its
ability to interrupt the setting reaction of polyether and
polyvinyl siloxane impression materials.[25,34] Owing to its
iron content, FS stains the gingival tissue yellow-brown
to black color for a few days after its application. It has
been shown to interfere with surface details of impression
materials, as well as discolor dentin by precipitating
ferric sulfide in an anaerobic environment.[25] Irrigation
with water for at least 10 s eliminates the staining and
discoloration effect of ferric compounds on gingiva and
esthetic restorations. Furthermore, two studies reported
that chlorhexidine gluconate helps achieve hemostasis
in a shorter time due to its surfactant effect.[34,35] Shaw
et al.
[36] observed reversible damage to the connective
tissue adjacent to the sulcular gingiva after application
of FS. Nevertheless, when used within the gingival sulcus
for <10 min, they cause minimal tissue damage.[21-23]
Management of postextraction hemorrhage
FS is not widely used to control postextraction hemorrhage;
however, it may offer assistance with mucosal tears or
uncontrolled postextraction hemorrhage in gingival
tissues.[37]
As hemostatic agent used in periradicular and
endodontic surgery
Control of bleeding during any surgical procedure is
imperative and can be achieved by practical and effective
systemic or topical approaches. Epinephrine pellets used
either alone or in combination with a FS-soaked pellet
are effective topical hemostats when applied in the bony
crypt under light pressure.[38] Aluminum chloride alone or
in combination with FS (Stasis®) appeared to be the most
efficient hemostatic agent to control the bleeding during
periapical surgery.[15,39]
Vickers et al.
[2] reported that in one-third of the cases where
FS was used some oozing of blood occurred in the bony
crypt and suction was required to maintain the dryness
of the root-end preparation. However, FS was found to
be less effective than aluminum chloride in controlling
the bleeding. Kim and Kratchman[40] recommended the
application of FS on small bleeding points of cortical bone
surface only.
An intense inflammatory response including foreign
body reaction and delayed osseous healing was
documented histologically after 18 and 46 days, when
FS was left in situ for maximum exposure.[5] However,
when adequately curetted and irrigated from the
surgical site before closure, FS neither causes persistent
inflammation nor delays osseous repair.[41] Adequate
hemostasis can be achieved following the application
of 20% FS (Viscostat®) for 5 s during the endodontic
surgeries such as root-end resection, root-end
preparation, and root-end filling.[2]
Merits and demerits
FS has several merits and a few demerits, which are shown
in Table 2.[4,8,9,12,25,28,31]
Toxicity
As FS is highly biocompatible, no concerns about toxic or
harmful effects have been reported in the dental literature
till date.[1,11,14]
CONCLUSION
The FS has been equally beneficial as a local hemostatic
agent compared to other chemical hemostatic agents. FS
is a commonly used astringent solution (15.5%) that has
multiple uses in dentistry. It is widely used in dentistry
as hemostatic agent. The use in restorative dentistry and
endodontics, pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, and oral
surgery has not been clearly documented. Hence, further
research is needed regarding the effective application of FS
in the various fields of the dentistry.
