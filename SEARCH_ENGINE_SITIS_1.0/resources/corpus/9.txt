RATIONALE: Classic Hodgkin lymphoma with pelvic involvement is a rare entity.
Diagnosis and treatment for such an uncommon disease are challenging. Here we
report a special case of classic Hodgkin lymphoma in pelvis.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 20-year-old woman was admitted to our department due to left 
hip symptoms. The patient reported a history of drenching night sweats, low-grade
fever, pruritic rash on the body, and an almost 15% weight loss during the
previous 3 months.
DIAGNOSES: Imaging studies revealed osteolytic destruction of the left
hemi-pelvic with a huge soft-tissue mass. Open biopsy established the
pathological diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma.
INTERVENTIONS: Considering the B symptom, bulky disease, and high risk of
pathological fracture of the patient, we performed limb-salvage surgery and 6
cycles ABVD chemotherapy with 2 cycles before surgery.
OUTCOMES: Up to now, at the 3-year follow-up, there is no sign of disease relapse
and metastasis. Besides, her limb function recovered well.
LESSONS: Based on this case and literature we reviewed, diagnoses for primary
bone Hodgkin lymphoma should be cautious. For the treatment, chemotherapy was the
main treatment option. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma patients seldom received tumor
resection surgery, but for the special bone classic Hodgkin lymphoma individual
with a huge tumor volume and high risk of pathological fracture in our study,
limb-salvage surgery based on ABVD chemotherapy provided a satisfying clinical
outcome.
