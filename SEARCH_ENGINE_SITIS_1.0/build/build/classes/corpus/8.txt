PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of the addition of consolidative radiation therapy 
after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation
(AHCT) for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records were reviewed from a total of 80
consecutive patients who underwent high-dose chemotherapy with AHCT treated under
a single protocol at University of Minnesota between November 2005 and January
2014. Of these, 32 patients received radiation therapy after AHCT as planned
consolidation.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 25 months, the 2-year overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) for the entire cohort was 96% and 52%,
respectively. Consolidative radiation therapy was found to significantly improve 
the 2-year PFS (67% vs 42%, P<.01) without a significant change in OS (100% vs
93%, P=.15). On subgroup analysis, consolidative radiation therapy was shown to
improve PFS in patients with bulky disease (62% vs 39%, P=.02), B-symptoms (48%
vs 28%, P=.05), primary refractory disease (47% vs 32%, P=.02), and those with a 
partial response on pretransplant imaging (47% vs 32%, P=.02). The improvement
seen on 2-year PFS with consolidative radiation therapy remained significant on
multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 4.64, 95% confidence interval 1.98-10.88).
Minimal toxicity was observed among the patients receiving radiation therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of consolidative radiation therapy after high-dose
chemotherapy and AHCT demonstrated a significant improvement in 2-year PFS and no
impact on OS. Radiation therapy was well tolerated, with minimal toxicity. Our
study supports a role of consolidative radiation therapy in patients with HL
treated with AHCT.
