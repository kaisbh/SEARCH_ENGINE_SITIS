This multicentre study evaluated 5-year progression-free (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) in early and advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), where therapy was
individualized based on initial prognostic factors and positron emission
tomography-computed tomography performed after two cycles (PET-2). Between
September 2006 and August 2013, 359 patients aged 18-60 years, were recruited in 
nine Israeli centres. Early-HL patients initially received ABVD (adriamycin,
bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) ×2. Depending on initial unfavourable
prognostic features, PET-2-positive patients received additional ABVD followed by
involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT). Patients with negative PET-2 and favourable
disease received ISRT or ABVD ×2; those with unfavourable disease received ABVD
×2 with ISRT or, alternatively, ABVD ×4. Advanced-HL patients initially received 
ABVD ×2 or escalated BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone; EB) ×2 based on their international
prognostic score (?2 or ?3). PET-2-negative patients further received ABVD ×4;
PET-2-positive patients received EB ×4 and ISRT to residual masses. With a median
follow-up of 55 (13-119) months, 5-year PFS was 91% and 69% for PET-2-negative
and positive early-HL, respectively; 5-year OS was 100% and 95%, respectively.
For advanced-HL, the PFS was 81% and 68%, respectively (P = 0·08); 5-year OS was 
98% and 91%, respectively. PET-2 positivity is associated with inferior prognosis
in early-HL, even with additional ABVD and ISRT. Advanced-HL patients benefit
from therapy escalation following positive PET-2. EB can be safely de-escalated
to ABVD in PET-2-negative patients.
