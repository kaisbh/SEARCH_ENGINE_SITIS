PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The choice for an optimal treatment in older lymphoma patients
is a real challenge for hemato-oncologists. They have to treat a potentially
curative lymphoma, and concomitantly protect their patients from unacceptable
toxicities. Some recommendations are provided for the major subtypes of lymphomas
including the antitumoral treatment and primarily the optimal supportive care.
RECENT FINDINGS: All the recent literature data converge to say that the approach
of an older patient with a malignant hemopathy is a multistep procedure. This
process comprises the appraisal of life expectancy of the patient with or without
the disease, the prognostic factors of the tumor, the functional, physiological
and cognitive functions evaluation, the socio-economical environment and the
patient's expectancy in terms of quality of life. Major progresses have been
achieved in the management of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and mantle cell
lymphoma in patients up to 80 and above 80 years old.
SUMMARY: With all these information in hands, the hematologist will decide if the
treatment's objective is the standard treatment with optimal supportive care (fit
patients), tailor-made adapted chemotherapy (unfit patients) or preservation of
quality of life (frail patients).
