Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) express multiple
immunoregulatory proteins that shape the cHL microenvironment and allow tumor
cells to evade immune surveillance. Expression of certain immunoregulatory
proteins is modulated by prosurvival transcription factors, such as NF?B and
STATs. Because these factors also induce expression of the oncogenic PIM1/2/3
serine/threonine kinases, and as PIMs modulate transcriptional activity of NF?B
and STATs, we hypothesized that these kinases support RS cell survival and foster
their immune privilege. Here, we investigated PIM1/2/3 expression in cHL and
assessed their role in developing RS cell immune privilege and survival. PIM1/2/3
were ubiquitously expressed in primary and cultured RS cells, and their
expression was driven by JAK-STAT and NF?B activity. Genetic or chemical PIM
inhibition with a newly developed pan-PIM inhibitor, SEL24-B489, induced RS cell 
apoptosis. PIM inhibition decreased cap-dependent protein translation, blocked
JAK-STAT signaling, and markedly attenuated NF?B-dependent gene expression. In a 
cHL xenograft model, SEL24-B489 delayed tumor growth by 95.8% (P = .0002).
Furthermore, SEL24-B489 decreased the expression of multiple molecules engaged in
developing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, including galectin-1 and
PD-L1/2. In coculture experiments, T cells incubated with SEL24-B489-treated RS
cells exhibited higher expression of activation markers than T cells coincubated 
with control RS cells. Taken together, our data indicate that PIM kinases in cHL 
exhibit pleiotropic effects, orchestrating tumor immune escape and supporting RS 
cell survival. Inhibition of PIM kinases decreases RS cell viability and disrupts
signaling circuits that link these cells with their niches. Thus, PIM kinases are
promising therapeutic targets in cHL.
