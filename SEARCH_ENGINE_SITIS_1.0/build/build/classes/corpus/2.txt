Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes oxidative
deamination of neurotransmitters and dietary amines and produces H2 O2 . It
facilitates the progression of gliomas and prostate cancer, but its expression
and functional relevance have not been studied in lymphoma. Here, we evaluated
MAOA in 427 cases of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and in a spectrum of
reactive lymphoid tissues by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded specimens. MAOA was expressed by Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS)
cells in the majority of classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs) (181/241; 75%), with 
34.8% showing strong expression. Weak MAOA was also noted in a minority of
primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (8/47; 17%) and in a mediastinal
gray-zone lymphoma. In contrast, no MAOA was found in non-neoplastic lymphoid
tissues, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL; 0/8) or any
other non-Hodgkin lymphomas studied (0/123). MAOA was more common in Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV)-negative compared to EBV-positive cHL (p < 0.0001) and was especially
prevalent in the EBV-negative nodular sclerosing subtype. Similar to primary
human lymphoma specimens, most cHL-derived cell lines displayed MAOA activity,
whereas non-Hodgkin-lymphoma-derived cell lines did not. The MAOA inhibitor
clorgyline reduced the growth of L1236 cells and U-HO1 cells, and shRNA knockdown
of MAOA reduced the growth of L1236 cells. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of 
MAOA increased the growth of MAOA-negative HDLM2 cells. Combined treatment with
clorgyline and ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) was more
effective in reducing cell growth than either regimen alone. In summary, MAOA is 
highly expressed in cHL and may reflect the distinct biology of this lymphoma.
Further studies on the potential utility of MAOA as a diagnostic marker and
therapeutic target are warranted. Copyright © 2017 Pathological Society of Great
